# cover-to-path
 Converts [sfinder](https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder)'s `cover` output into `path`'s `csv pattern` format. Useful for piping `cover` into [strict-minimals](https://github.com/eight04/sfinder-strict-minimal).
 Depends on my forked version of [GluingFumens](https://github.com/Hillosanation/GluingFumens/) for the ungluing script.

 Run `cover-to-path.py -h` for help in configuring comands.
